                                                                            SMART MINING SAFETY HELMET

PROBLEM:
  Develop an innovative mining safety helmet with advanced features to enhance protection and communication for miners, promoting safer working conditions underground.
  
REASON WHY WE TOOK THIS PROJECT :
  Recently, in Uttarakhand, nearly 40 miners have been trapped inside. In this situation, there seems to be a lack of communication between those inside and outside the mine, and there was no landslide alert either.
